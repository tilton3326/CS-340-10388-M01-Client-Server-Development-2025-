**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?**

Programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable are essential for effective collaboration and long term success. To achieve this, I focus on writing clear, organized code and thorough documentation. My work on the CRUD Python module from Project One exemplifies this approach. It abstracts database operations Create, Read, Update, Delete allowing other developers to focus on building the dashboard rather than database details making it swift for use within a team. This modular design makes the code easier to update, reuse, and debug. In the future, I can use this CRUD module for any Python project involving MongoDB, saving time and reducing errors.

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?**  

I start by thoroughly understanding the requirements, ensuring I know exactly what the client needs. For Grazioso Salvare, I carefully analyzed their database and dashboard needs, avoiding rushing into coding. My approach focuses on clear objectives and security considerations, which differs from earlier courses where I was more focused on technical implementation. Moving forward, I plan to emphasize detailed planning, secure design, and modular development to meet client needs effectively.

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?**  

Computer scientists develop innovative solutions using programming and data analysis that address societal challenges. Our work helps organizations operate more efficiently, make informed decisions, and improve lives. In this project, I helped Grazioso Salvare better identify and train rescue dogs through data analytics and a user-friendly dashboard, making their work more effective and impactful.
